# -Feature-Cleaning-and-Data-Standardization
This rigorous cleaning pipeline resulted in a fully standardized, consistent, and model-ready dataset. The project successfully eliminated significant data inconsistencies and improved feature quality, which is expected to boost the performance and interpretability of any downstream machine learning models.
